# Document-analysis-using-LLMs
Here's a README file for the topic "Document Analysis Using LLMs with Python":

## üìù **Overview**

Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT and other advanced NLP tools have revolutionized document analysis. This project showcases practical techniques to split, analyze, and derive meaningful information from textual data. It serves as a guide to automate and simplify complex text processing tasks.

## üöÄ **Features**

- **Text Tokenization**: Breaking down large documents into sentences or smaller chunks.
- **Text Summarization**: Extracting the key points from the content for quick understanding.
- **Insight Extraction**: Identifying trends, keywords, or critical information from text.
- **Customization**: Adapting the analysis process for specific use cases like legal, financial, or educational documents.

## üõ† **Technologies Used**

- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: For tokenization and basic text processing.
- **Transformers**: For using pre-trained language models like GPT.
- **Pandas**: To manage and structure document data efficiently.
